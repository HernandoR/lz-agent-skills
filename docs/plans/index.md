# Architecture Decision Records

This directory holds ADRs — settled design decisions recorded for future
reference. Each ADR captures context, the decision made, and its consequences.

ADRs use the template at `skills/adr-driven-development/references/adr-template.md`.

For proposals that are still under discussion, see `docs/rfc/`.

## File Naming

```text
adr-{id}-{kebab-case-title}-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md
```

- `id` is a zero-padded four-digit sequence, independent from RFC IDs.
- `kebab-case-title` is a short slug; prefer six words or fewer.
- `YYYY-MM-DD` is the draft date.

## Process

- Proposals that need discussion belong in `docs/rfc/` — use `skills/write-rfc`.
- Once a decision is settled, create an ADR here — use `skills/adr-driven-development`.
- Existing records are historical artifacts and are not updated only to match
  later template changes.
